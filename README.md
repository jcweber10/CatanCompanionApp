# CatanCompanionApp
This is an android app meant to be used alongside the Settlers of Catan boardgame. It simulates rolling dice through the use of a random number generator and rapidly changing ImageViews. The app has an activity dedicated to keeping a running list of all previous rolls as well as an activity that displays how many times each number has rolled. It keeps track of player turns for 2-6 players, and it also accommodates the event die for the Cities and Knights expansion. I wrote it to replace my Catan repository in order to practice the MVC model.
